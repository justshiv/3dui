                            You will be given 3 types of tasks to complete during this experimental evaluation.
                            Each task has specific instructions on what is expected of you.
                            Please aim to complete each <b>quickly and accurately</b> and press the "submit" button once you are done.
                            Please read these carefully and clear up any questions you have with your instructor <b>before</b> you begin the task.
                            In the descriptions below the "start" image shows how the scene loads, and the "end" image shows the ideal solution.

                        <h4>Align on Rectangle Tasks</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                             <div class="col-lg-12">
                                <p>
                                    These tasks require you to line up the letter/number object in your scene with the the center of the black rectangle in the scene.
                                    Your goal is that the object lies flat in center of the rectangle, so that the rectangle appears to cut letter/number in half.
                                    The orientation of the object once it is in this position doesn't matter.
                                    You are able to move and rotate only the letter/number object.
                                </p>

                        <h4>Dodecahedron Tasks</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                             <div class="col-lg-12">

                                    A dodecahedron is a 10 sided shape, where each face is a pentagon.
                                    This task has a dodecahedron in the center of the screen.
                                    The dodecahedron has "cutouts" that correspond to 1 number/letter.
                                    As you can see in the image below, there is a yellow dodecahedron, with a grey cut-out F.
                                    This corresponds to the pink F on the bottom left.
                                    The number/letter object corresponding to the cut-out is also visible in your scene.
                                    These tasks requires you to slot the object into the cutout in the dodecahedron.
                                    You are able to move and rotate only the letter/number object.
                                </p>

                                    These tasks have 2 sub-tasks.
                                    First, you must place the table onto the tiled floor so that it is centered on the highlighted rectangle, and the table legs touch the floor.
                                    Second, you are required to place the lamp onto the table in the center of highlighted circle.
                                    Ensure that both the table, floor and lamp all have the same rotation.
                                    Note, you are able to move all 3 objects in this scene.
