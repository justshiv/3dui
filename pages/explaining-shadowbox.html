                            The image below shows you your scene from all angles as if it were surrounded by a "box".
                            On each side of the box, you can see the scene from only that angle.
                            You can imagine this as a "shadow", where every side of the box shows you the shadows the objects would cast on that side.
                            You can interact with the objects through their shadows, as well as with the objects themselves through the main view.
                            The shadows can be manipulated on only 2 axes.
                            In the main view, you can manipulate the object on any axis desired.
