                            In this evaluation, you will be evaluating two different three dimensional user interfaces (3DUIs).
                            You will be doing this by completing tasks which will be presented to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please know that in this evaluation we are testing the interface, not you.
                            If you get stuck and are not sure of how to proceed, please ask the evaluation coordinator for help.
                            If you would like to end the experiment at anytime, you are welcome to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please complete each task you are given accurately and quickly.
                        </p>
                        <b> Evaluation Procedure </b>
                        <ol>
                            <li> You will first complete a Mental Rotations Test (MRT). The instructions for this are on the next page. </li>
                            <li> You will then be asked to complete some tasks. The documentation is presented in a booklet in front of you and will be accessible on each page under "Help". </li>
                            <li> After you have completed a set of tasks, you will be asked to evaluate the 3DUI's usability using a SUS questionnaire. </li>
                        </ol>

                        If you need to refer back to anything read above, you can consult the hard copy of the manual.
